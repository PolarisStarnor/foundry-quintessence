# TODO:
- [ ] Screw with effects to see if they actually can do what I want them to do.
- [ ] See if I can clash two rolls directly.
- [ ] As an addendum to clashing, I also want to try doing the additive combo damage, like was intended.
- [ ] Probably needs some degree of nesting in the rolls? Sounds annoying, but it'd make me feel cool
- [ ] Do something about the super fancy special moves, along with sanity not sanity(tm)
