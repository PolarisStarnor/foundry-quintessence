# TODO:
- See if I can clash two rolls directly.
- As an addenum to clashing, I also want to try doing the additive combo damage, like was intended.
- Probably needs some degree of nesting in the rolls? Sounds annoying, but it'd make me feel cool
- Screw with effects to see if they actually can do what I want them to do.
- Do something about the super fancy special moves, along with sanity not sanity(tm)
